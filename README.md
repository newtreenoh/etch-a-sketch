#Intro
This project is a browser-based Etch-a-Sketch game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user can draw on the grid, resize the grid, and clear the grid to start again. Additional features include a colorful version, a gradient version, random shapes within the grid, and adjustable opacity for colored cells.
