- Gradient Version: Click on the "Gradient" button to switch to a version where the color of each square is based on its position in the grid, creating a gradient effect.

- Random Shapes: Click on the "Change Shape" button to switch to a version where each square displays a randomly generated shape, such as a circle, triangle, or polygon.

- Adjustable Opacity: Hover over a square to increase its opacity by 10% each time, up to a maximum of 100%.
